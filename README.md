ðŸš€ Automating Social Media Interactions: My Latest Python Script ðŸ’»

I recently worked on a Python script designed to automate interactions on various social media engagement platforms. This script demonstrates how to:

Log in to multiple platforms programmatically.

Access specific tools (like sending followers).

Handle form submissions and responses using Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup.


The primary goal of this script is to explore automation techniques, demonstrate coding best practices, and learn about efficient data handling across web platforms.

ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights:

Handles multiple websites with varying login and action page structures.

Uses session-based requests for streamlined interactions.

Includes structured logging for debugging and improving functionality.


This script is intended for educational purposes only and complies with ethical coding practices. Itâ€™s an excellent learning resource for those interested in Python automation and web scraping!

ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer: Automation must always respect platform rules and ethical guidelines. Please ensure any use of this code aligns with the terms of service of the platforms you work with.
